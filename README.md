# Practice-Git
A dummy repo to practice git. Feel free to do anything with it ðŸ˜„.    

Choose either the vscode or CLI approach. The vscode approach is more beginner friendly.
## To stage, commit a file
In VSCode:
1. Add, delete, or change the fruits.
2. Go to left side bar -> Source control
3. Click on "+" for files that you changed. Your files are now staged. 
4. Add commit message: eg. "Add pear" 
5. Click on Commit. Your commits are now made to your local repo.

In CLI:
```
git add .            //stage all files
git commit -m "Add pear"
```

## To push your local changes to the remote repo
Rationale: Your local commits are only present in your local repo.    
Hence we need to push the changes to the remote repo so that everyone else can see it.  

In VSCode:      
1. Click on Sync changes. 

In CLI:
```
git push
```

âœ¨Done! Go to GitHub to see the latest changes.
