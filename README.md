# Practice-Git
A dummy repo to practice git. Feel free to do anything with it ðŸ˜„.    

Choose either the vscode or CLI approach. The vscode approach is more beginner friendly.

As time passes I'll add more git actions here. For now just focus on these basic steps:
## To stage, commit a file
In VSCode:
1. Add, delete, or change the fruits.
2. Go to left side bar -> Source control
3. Click on "+" for files that you changed. Your files are now staged. 
4. Add commit message: eg. "Add pear" 
5. Click on Commit. Your commits are now made to your local repo.

In CLI:
```
git add .            //stage all files
git commit -m "Add pear"
```
